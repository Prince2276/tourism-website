Create and configure MySQL database

Create a database (e.g., tourism_db)

Usage
Explore the landing page to view destinations and packages.

Future Enhancements
Here are some ideas to improve or extend the project:

User authentication (login / registration) for travellers and admin.

Full booking flow (select package, book, payment integration).

Admin dashboard with analytics (popular destinations, enquiry stats).

Image upload for destinations/packages and dynamic gallery.

Mobile-first UI or move to a front-end framework (React, Angular, Vue).

Deploy it to a cloud hosting platform (AWS, Heroku, Azure) with CI/CD.
